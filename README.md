Welcome to the landing page of "security.context", my cybersecurity focused blog. Don't forget your PPE because this site is under heavy development.<br><br>
## <u>About</u>
Hi, I'm Kolby. A good way to sum up the bulk of my life is: if it connects to the internet or has an engine... I'm interested in it. As a Cybersecurity Analyst, I take a lot of notes... like a lot of notes, particularly in markdown and it's always been an interest of mine to have a blog. Anyways, enjoy!<br><br>
