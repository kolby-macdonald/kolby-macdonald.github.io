*Day 2*<br>
**Progress:** I'm going to continue progress on the Hack The Box Academy's Certified Defensive Security Analyst. More specifically, I'm working through the Windows Attacks & Defence course.<br><br>
**Personal Note:** Migrating notes over is going to take a large amount of work, however, once it's done I think it'll be worth it. Last night I realized I can't simply paste a lot of my markdown notes in here and be good to go since a lot of them contain copied or snipped material from sources I don't have permission to share from... This should be interesting.<br>

*Day 1*<br>
**Progress:** Today's the day I created this blog! I mostly worked on getting the index route (README.md) up and running with a links that work for both the site and internally for the obsidian app.<br><br>
**Personal Note:** That means you've reached the end and as a reward: RTW means Run The World! <br>
